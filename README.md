## 🧑‍💻 Coding Platforms

### 🧠 HackerRank
- **Mac** — Works with Focus **On** or **Off**. *(Recommended: **Off**)*  
- **Windows** — Focus **must be Off**. If left **On**, **active-tab detection** may trigger when focus leaves the coding pad.

### 📊 CodeSignal
- **Mac** — Works with Focus **On** or **Off**. *(Recommended: **Off**)*  
- **Windows** — Focus **must be Off**. Otherwise, **lost focus** will be detected.

### 💻 CoderPad
- **Mac** — Works with Focus **On** or **Off**. *(Recommended: **Off**)*  
- **Windows** — Focus **must be Off** to avoid **active-tab detection**.

### 🖥️ Coderbyte
- **Mac** — Works with Focus **On** or **Off**. *(Recommended: **Off**)*  
- **Windows** — Focus **must be Off**. Otherwise, **suspicious focus loss** may occur.

#### Developer note (Windows)
- When typing in WhisprGPT, the **cursor/focus will leave** the coding pad of the platform (e.g., HackerRank, CodeSignal, CoderPad, Coderbyte).  
- Keeping **Focus Off/Inactive** prevents suspicious activity because **WhisprGPT does not steal focus**.
